# Super Paws
A little app project we built during a hackathon when experimenting on JavaScript fetch function. The idea is the app fetches heroes names with their stats and puppy images from two separate APIs then combine them. The result is cute photos of puppies with superheroes names. Teck stack, (JavaScript, HTML and CSS).
Collaborators (Kelly, Gordon and Ihab).
