# Super Paws
A little app project built during a hakathon when experimenting on JavaScript fetch function. The idea is the app fetches heroes names with theirs stats and puppy images from two separate apis then combine them together, the end result is cute photos of puppies with super heroes names. Tech stack, (JavaScript, HTML and CSS).
Collaborators (Kelly, Gordon and Ihab).
